# Milk+
Milk+ is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that adds new interactions with milk.
# Features
- Milk buckets can be placed. This is default behavior. Milk can still be drank by crouching while trying to drink it. 
- Standing in fluid milk removes all status effects as if you drank it.
- Milk can be put into cauldrons. 
  - Milk bottles can be made by removing milk from a cauldron using glass bottles. Milk bottles remove 1 random status effect when drank.
  - Dyable items will be dyed white when used on a milk cauldron.
